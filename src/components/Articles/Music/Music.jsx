Each measure lasts for two seconds and each "note" is a prominent facial expression -- higher on the scale when looking up and lower when looking down.

          <p>
            The expressions we looked for were { _.map(emoji, (emoji, expression) => `${expression == "CONFUSED" ? ",  and" : expression == "DISGUSTED" ? "" : ", "}  ${emoji} ${_.lowerCase(expression)}`)}.

            Musicians also emote with other facial expressions, such as closing their eyes ({ eyesClosedIcon }) and raising their eyebrows (‚åí). Run through the piece and see if you can find their idiosyncracies.
