        Goal: we need to make the distinction obvious

        Problems:
            makes data feel overwhelming - fights public data literacy
            for a designer who doesn't understand data visualization, the consequences can be:
                obfuscating the data
                but more likely mis-representing the data and unintentionally lying
            over-stressing data visualization design
                making less-compelling visuals

            Designers for dashboards
            Explanatory vs Exploratory visualizations
            How much effort should a user put in to understand?

            

            What's the goal?
                to evoke an emotional connection
                to quickly convey an insight
            
            music notation vs listening to music

            are there rules/standards?
